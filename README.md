# SPAngJS-Project
Single page Web apps using AJS


In Mod1_solution: I have made use of Angular JS and its directives to create a simple Front-End Application which helps a person to check if he/she is having enough food for lunch or is it too much.
The user enters items which are comma seperated into an input box and this Angular JS Application outputs the result.
